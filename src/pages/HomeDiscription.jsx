        <p className="my-4 md:font-medium md:text-lg">
          Jubilee Batch Scholarship is awarded to ten second-year students, one
          from each department of engineering at BIT Sindri, who can provide
          evidence of severe financial hardships yet maintaining noteworthy
          academic performance in the first year (does not need to be in the top
          few). The selection is made either by each head of departments, or by
          Prayas75 selection committee. Each candidate is video interviewed
          before final award to ensure that they really need the support due to
          financial hardships and they are sincerely pursuing engineering with
          clean disciplinary record. The scholarship beneficiaries receive total
          of Rs 60,000 distributed in three years (second, third and the fourth
          years) as long as they are able to sustain their academic performance.
